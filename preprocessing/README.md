`compression_parse.py` generates the data files that feed the visualization of the LZ algorithm (`src/js/compression.js`).

## infgen

`compression_parse.py` works on two input files, one a raw text file (representing some lyrics), and an 'infgen' file, which is just the output of running [infgen](https://github.com/madler/infgen) on a compressed version of the same text file.

infgen does the dirty work of parsing out the pieces generated by the LZ algorithm, before everyone gets huffman coded.

## Compression

All the reported stats are based on compressed files produced by running `gzip -9`.

For the purposes of this visualization though, I've used [Zopfli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zopfli), which also produces deflate output readable by infgen. Zopfli output was just a few % smaller than what I got from gzip, but aesthetically it seemed a lot nicer. (i.e. it lacked a lot of dumb mistakes that stuck out)
