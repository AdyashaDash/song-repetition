In 1977, the great computer scientist Donald 
Knuth published a paper called The Complexity of 
Songs, which is basically one long joke about the 
repetitive lyrics of newfangled music (example 
quote: "the advent of modern drugs has led to 
demands for still less memory, and the ultimate 
improvement of Theorem 1 has consequently just 
been announced").

I'm going to try to test this hypothesis with 
data. I'll be analyzing the repetitiveness of a 
dataset of 15,000 songs that charted on the 
Billboard Hot 100 between 1958 and 2017.
