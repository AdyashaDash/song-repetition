            <blockquote>
                Knock, knock, knock, knock<br/>
                Knock, knock, knock, knock<br/><br/>

                Crazy little mama come knocking<br/>
                Knocking at my front door<br/>
                Crazy little mama come knocking<br/>
                Knocking at my front door

            <p>2014 is the most repetitive year on record. An average song from this year compresses 22% more efficiently than one from 1960.</p>
            <p><small>* Each point actually represents a 3-year rolling average. 2015 is the last year having a full year of data on either side of it.</small></p>
            <p><small>** "Repetition score" is basically the logarithm of the ratio between raw size and compressed size, so the 22% figure comes from taking <code>e^(1.15-0.95)</code>, where 1.15 and 0.95 are the repetition scores of 2014 and 1960, respectively.</small></p>
