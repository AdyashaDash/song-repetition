            <p>2014 is the most repetitive year on record. An average song from this year compresses 22% more efficiently than one from 1960.</p>
            <p><small>* Each point actually represents a 3-year rolling average. 2015 is the last year having a full year of data on either side of it.</small></p>
            <p><small>** 22% is the relative difference. i.e. if we took random songs from 2014 and 1960 having the same length, we'd expect the compressed 2014 song to be 22% smaller than the compressed 1960 songs.</small></p>
