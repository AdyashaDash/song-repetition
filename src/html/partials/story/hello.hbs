<h2>Measuring repetitiveness</h2>
<p>Lyrics compression/decompression demo should go here.</p>

<h2>Per-artist repetitiveness</h2>
<p>Artists on the right are more repetitive. Use the radio buttons below to choose different decades. Artists are assigned a year based on the median of their charting songs.</p>
<p>Currently limited to artists with at least 20 charting songs. Probably want to tune that number (or take a fixed # per decade).</p>

            <p>In 1960, the average repetition-score of the hot-100 is 0.95. The most repetitive song of the year is Dee Clark's <i>At My Front Door</i>. Sample:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Knock, knock, knock, knock<br/>
                Knock, knock, knock, knock<br/><br/>

                Crazy little mama come knocking<br/>
                Knocking at my front door<br/>
                Crazy little mama come knocking<br/>
                Knocking at my front door

            <p>By 1980, disco has reached the peak of its popularity. The year's most repetitive song is <i>Funkytown</i>, which spends 4 weeks at #1.</p>

        <div class="scrolly-slide stage3">
            <p>2014 is the most repetitive year on record. An average song from this year compresses 22% more efficiently than one from 1960.</p>
            <p><small>* Each point actually represents a 3-year rolling average. 2015 is the last year having a full year of data on either side of it.</small></p>
            <p><small>** "Repetition score" is basically the logarithm of the ratio between raw size and compressed size, so the 22% figure comes from taking <code>e^(1.15-0.95)</code>, where 1.15 and 0.95 are the repetition scores of 2014 and 1960, respectively.</small></p>
